Introduction
	Existing intro
A survey of modern gradual typing systems
	The search space - and why we chose the 4 we did

	code examples w/ paragraph or two for the following:
	Typed Racket
		"macro" typing w/ wrappers
	Strongscript
		Optional typing, no wrappers
	Transient
		"Untrusted everyone" checking, strongscript style checks
	Monotonic
		Heap updates galore
	Hard to compare - point out syntactic differences and immaterial semantic diffs
Solution: a common calculus for all of these languages
	Limited case study: choosing a gradual typing system for a simple object oriented language
	Target language - the base, starting, language
		Introduce dynamics
		Introduce statics
	Gradual type systems on top of this core
		Introduce common translation
		Go through each system etc.
Properties of gradual typing systems
	Key theorems
		etc etc - ideally 1 for each
	Developer implications
		etc etc - hark back to theorems
Conclusion
