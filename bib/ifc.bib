	Abstract = {JavaScript is a popular language for client-side web scripting. It has a dubious reputation among programmers for two reasons. First, many JavaScript programs are written against a rapidly evolving API whose implementations are sometimes contradictory and idiosyncratic. Second, the language is only weakly typed and comes virtually without development tools.   The present work is a first attempt to address the second point. It does so by defining a type system that tracks the possible traits of an object and flags suspicious type conversions. Because JavaScript is a classless, object-based language with first-class functions, the type system must include singleton types, subtyping, and first class record labels. The type system covers a representative subset of the language and there is a type soundness proof with respect to an operational semantics.},

@incollection{livshits05APLAS,
	Abstract = {Reflection has always been a thorn in the side of Java static analysis tools. Without a full treatment of reflection, static analysis tools are both incomplete because some parts of the program may not be included in the application call graph, and unsound because the static analysis does not take into account reflective features of Java that allow writes to object fields and method invocations. However, accurately analyzing reflection has always been difficult, leading to most static analysis tools treating reflection in an unsound manner or just ignoring it entirely. This is unsatisfactory as many modern Java applications make significant use of reflection.   In this paper we propose a static analysis algorithm that uses points-to information to approximate the targets of reflective calls as part of call graph construction. Because reflective calls may rely on input to the application, in addition to performing reflection resolution, our algorithm also discovers all places in the program where user-provided specifications are necessary to fully resolve reflective targets. As an alternative to user-provided specifications, we also propose a reflection resolution approach based on type cast information that reduces the need for user input, but typically results in a less precise call graph.    We have implemented the reflection resolution algorithms described in this paper and applied them to a set of six large, widely-used benchmark applications consisting of more than 600,000 lines of code combined. Experiments show that our technique is effective for resolving most reflective calls without any user input. Certain reflective calls, however, cannot be resolved at compile time precisely. Relying on a user-provided specification to obtain a conservative call graph results in graphs that contain 1.43 to 6.58 times more methods that the original. In one case, a conservative call graph has 7,047 more methods than a call graph that does not interpret reflective calls. In contrast, ignoring reflection leads to missing substantial portions of the application call graph.},

	Abstract = {Drive-by download attacks are among the most common methods for spreading malware today. These attacks typically exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in web browsers and browser plug-ins to execute shellcode, and in consequence, gain control of a victim’s computer. Compromised machines are then used to carry out various malicious activities, such as joining botnets, sending spam emails, or participating in distributed denial of service attacks.  To counter drive-by downloads, we propose a technique that relies on x86 instruction emulation to identify JavaScript string buffers that contain shellcode. Our detection is integrated into the browser, and performed before control is transfered to the shellcode, thus, effectively thwarting the attack. The solution maintains fair performance by avoiding unnecessary invocations of the emulator, while ensuring that every buffer with potential shellcode is checked. We have implemented a prototype of our system, and evaluated it over thousands of malicious and legitimate web sites. Our results demonstrate that the system performs accurate detection with no false positives.},

	Abstract = {JavaScript is the main scripting language for Web browsers, and it is essential to modern Web applications. Programmers have started using it for writing complex applications, but there is still little tool support available during development.  We present a static program analysis infrastructure that can infer detailed and sound type information for JavaScript programs using abstract interpretation. The analysis is designed to support the full language as defined in the ECMAScript standard, including its peculiar object model and all built-in functions. The analysis results can be used to detect common programming errors – or rather, prove their absence, and for producing type information for program comprehension.    Preliminary experiments conducted on real-life JavaScript code indicate that the approach is promising regarding analysis precision on small and medium size programs, which constitute the majority of JavaScript applications. With potential for further improvement, we propose the analysis as a foundation for building tools that can aid JavaScript programmers.},
